## üéØ Project Goals

- Understand the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Analyze release trends by year and month
- Explore countries contributing most content
- Visualize most popular genres and durations
- Highlight missing metadata (directors, cast, etc.)

## üîß Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data wrangling
- **Matplotlib (pyplot)** ‚Äì static plotting

---

## üìä Key Visual Insights

- **Movies dominate** over TV Shows in total titles available
- Most content is produced in the **United States**, with India and the UK also contributing significantly
- **Content additions peaked** in 2019‚Äì2020, indicating rapid platform growth
- **Genres like Documentaries, Dramas, and Comedies** are most frequent
- Many entries lack complete metadata, which could impact recommendation systems
